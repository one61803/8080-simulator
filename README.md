P.S. 2024-07-26 0:01 : I think that there was an error in this; not something that could not be corrected (if I wrapped my mind into it again).
Something about Little Endian versus Big Endian: using one when supposed to be using the other one.

There is a book about 8080 ICs by Kathe Spracklen: *Z-80 and 8080 Assembly Language Programming*. (There is also a channel on YouTube by Kathleen Spracklen about Zettelkasten (and also writing); they are the same person.)
